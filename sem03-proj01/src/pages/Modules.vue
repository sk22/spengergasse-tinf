        <h3>And the 2016 winner is... üèÜ</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.JS</a> project got more than 25,000 stars on Github last year, it means 72 stars by day, it's more than any other framework, including React and Angular.
          The version 2, that takes advantage of the Virtual DOM for performance, was released in October.
          Vue.JS is used in production by big companies (including Alibaba, the biggest e-commerce company in China), so you can consider it as a safe choice.
          There is already a quite mature eco-system around it, including a router (vue-router) and a state management library (Vuex).
          It seems that Vue.JS took the best of React (the component approach) and AngularJS (templates are html code enhanced by the framework features).
